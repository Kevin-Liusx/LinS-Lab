Lin Shao is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS), School of Computing. His research interests lie at the intersection of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. His long-term goal is to build general-purpose robotic systems that intelligently perform a diverse range of tasks in a large variety of environments in the physical world. Specifically, his group is interested in developing algorithms and systems to provide robots with the abilities of perception and manipulation.

He is a co-chair of the Technical Committee on Robot Learning in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society and serves as the Associated Editor at ICRA 2024. His work received the Best System Paper Award finalist at RSS 2023. Previously, he received his PhD at Stanford University, advised by Jeannette Bohg and co-advised by Leonidas J. Guibas. He received his BS in Geochemistry from Nanjing University.
