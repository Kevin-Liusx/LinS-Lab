Hi there! I'm a first-year PhD student (Aug. 2024-) at School of Computing, NUS, advised by Prof. Lin Shao. I am supported by the President's Graduate Fellowship (PGF).

I obtained my B.Eng (Sep. 2020 - Jun. 2024) in Robotics ðŸ¤– from Zhejiang University, where I am lucky to work with Kechun Xu, Prof. Rong Xiong and Prof. Yue Wang.
