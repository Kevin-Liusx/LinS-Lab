I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computing, National University of Singapore, supervised by Prof. Lin Shao. Before this, I received my B.S. degree from School of EECS, Peking University in 2024. In my undergraduate study, I am privileged to work with Prof. Hao Dong and Prof. He Wang.

It's worth mentioning that before I study computer science, I majored in physics. My research focuses on constructing models by incorporating varying degrees of physics intuitions based on the specific characteristics of different robot manipulation tasks, so that the robot can more efficiently complete a variety of manipulation tasks in the physical world.
